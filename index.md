My name is Justina Schiroo. I’m a PhD student at the University of Minnesota studying Human Factors & Ergonomics. I’m interested in the challenges surrounding high-stress situations, human behavior, and the procedures designed to respond to those situations.

Human Factors is the study of how humans behave physically and psychologically in relation to particular environments, products, or services. We occupy an intersection of psychology, engineering, and design, and use an iterative process that invites user feedback throughout the design process.
