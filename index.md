Hello! My name is Justina, and Iâ€™m somewhere between a technical business analyst and a product owner/manager. I'm enthusiastic about working with developers to solve problems in a way that both tries to live up to stakeholder dreams and meets user needs.

 I have a particular passion for iterative design to constantly pursue solutions that are simple, efficient and truly designed for the people who will actually use what I help to create.

 I work in a world where I need to understand the way our systems currently work, document and help evaluate them, and lay out the vision for the next version that gracefully accomplishes our goals, even as they change.

 I thrive on seeing the big picture of how everything works and understanding user needs, including those of my team. I'm an advocate for finding the most effective, simple solutions, and I am always working to establish and promote good development and project management practices.

 I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Master's degree in Human Factors & Ergonomics.
