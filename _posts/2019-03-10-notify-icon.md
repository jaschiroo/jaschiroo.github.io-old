This weekend's adventure was getting a Mac and Sketch to learn how to use the most-referenced software for jobs that I'm
looking at! Experience that I've had with GIMP and Moqups has actually transferred pretty well to this new tool, although
I will say that Sketch has an incredible user interface from a beginner's perspective, with lots of accelerators that are
easy to pick up as I gain experience!

My first thought was to go find tutorials, and I stumbled across [this tutorial by Daniel Schwarz](https://designmodo.com/icon-design-sketch/?u=2022)
to make an icon featuring a moon. This was my first real introduction to using vector graphics to create an image - previously
I have used Illustrator to create files for laser cutting. The tutorial also contained a link to an amazing Sketch plugin,
the Aeiconizer Plugin! This is amazing - you create a base icon, and it automatically scales your icon to all of the required sizes!

After making the moon-icon in the tutorial, I decided to try my hand at an icon for the notification app. The larger name
of the LLC that technically "owns" all of the endeavours is "siphono", after siphonophores, which are colonies of organisms
that appear to be a single organism - the most well-known is the Portuguese Man o' War, which isn't a jellyfish. I searched
around a bit for inspiration, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute posted this [image of a rare jelly, Vampyrocrossota childressi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoAJCIhFgmF/)
(I know, it isn't a siphonophore, but I didn't realize that until later!) that got me inspired! So I started brainstorming
and sketching out some ideas. Here are the first few.

<img style="max-width:90%;height:auto;border:1px solid black;"
  src="/assets/notify/icon-2a.svg"
  title="Icon idea variation on 2">

There were some things I liked about each of them, and some that I didn't.
