# Hi there! #

My name is Justina Schiroo. I’m a recent graduate from the the University of Minnesota in Human Factors & Ergonomics. I’m interested in the challenges of interface design, user experience design, human behavior, and the process of designing for the people who actually use what I make.

Human Factors is the study of how humans behave physically and psychologically in relation to particular environments, products, or services. We occupy an intersection of psychology, engineering, and design, and use an iterative process that invites user feedback throughout the design process.
